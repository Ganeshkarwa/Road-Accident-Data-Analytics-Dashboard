# Road-Accident-Data-Analytics-Dashboard
This project aims to create interactive dashboards for analyzing road accident data for the years 2021 and 2022. The project consists of two main components: a requirements dashboard for analyzing accident data and a stakeholders dashboard for providing insights to various stakeholders in the transportation sector.

## Requirements Dashboard

The requirements dashboard provides detailed analysis and visualization of road accident data, including:

- Total casualties monthly trend
- Casualties by road type
- Primary KPIs such as total casualties after accidents and percentages with respect to severity and maximum casualties by vehicle type
- Secondary KPIs including casualties by vehicle type, monthly trend comparisons, and maximum casualties by road type and day/night
- Visualization of the distribution of total casualties

## Stakeholders Dashboard

The stakeholders dashboard caters to various stakeholders in the transportation sector, including:

- Ministry of Transport
- Road Transport Department
- Police Force
- Emergency Services Department
- Road Safety Corps
- Transport Operators
- Traffic Management Agencies
- Public
- Media

For each stakeholder, the dashboard provides relevant data and insights such as serious and slight casualties, monthly trend comparisons, and location-based data.
